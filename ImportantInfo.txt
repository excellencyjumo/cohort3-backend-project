Hello Engineers!

For now, in development, I have chosen port "3004" for testing purposes in the environment file (this can be  I guess)

Also, for development purpose, I am using a test database (Compass), I will reach out to Marv to know if this is okay though.

So here is an explanation of the config folder. 
- The config folder contains 2 files. 
    ðŸ”¸ The config.env stores your environment variables. The "PORT" and "DB_URL" variables are stored in here.
    ðŸ”¸ The database.js stores your database connection code.
        Here is the sample code of the database.js file in the config folder:
        
            const mongoose = require('mongoose');

            const connectDatabase = ( ) => {
                mongoose.connect(process.env.DB_URI, {
                    useNewUrlParser:true,
                    useUnifiedTopology:true,
                })
                .then(()=> {
                    console.log('Database Connected Successfully!');
                })
                .catch((err) => {
                    console.log(err);
                });
                    
                };


            module.exports = connectDatabase;
    
When you clone the repository, you may decide to change it to a code that soothes you and add the folder to the .gitignore file.



Also, the LICENCE and the README files will be updated as we progress on the project.
